To reproduce Figure 2-3 , Run the code GenerateFigs2And3.m
To reproduce Figure 4-5 , Run the code GenerateFig4.m and GenerateFig5.m

to generate the rest of the simulations in the report:
  for speech signals run : TestOnSpeechSignal.m
  for Parameter Experiments, Run different sections of ParameterExperiments.m which uses GenerateFigs2And3.m with different parameters.
